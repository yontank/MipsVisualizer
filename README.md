# MIPS Visualizer

This is a web app made with React and TypeScript that visualizes a MIPS processor.  
It lets you write a MIPS assembly program, run it, and inspect the values of each wire and component in the CPU as it's running.

<!-- It also lets you add new components into the diagram to change how the CPU functions. -->

The diagram is based on the single-cycle MIPS implementation from the book _Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface_.  
The pipelined version of the CPU will be implemented in the future.

## Installation
